Description:


 "285 Technology" Series #1

This cache is part of the "285 Technology" Series of Caches by Rfair & Boo. All of the caches in this series have two things in common.

1 - they are located close to 285 - most of the cache locations provide an interesting view of 285 that you've probably never seen before.

2 - they incorporate some form of technology in the puzzle - use of third party tools such as web browsers may be required.

Please note that all of these caches require you to visit webpages located outside of geocaching.com and are in no way audited or approved by groundspeak directly. We've made every effort to ensure that the assets are secure, however you should USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
